## Task Graph Text Description:

This task graph outlines the steps a robot would take to weigh liquid samples, specifically aiming for 1.00 gram. The robot uses its gripper for object manipulation and a vision system to read the scale.

1.  **Open Cabinet:** The robot opens the "PRE CERAMIC MATERIALS" cabinet using its gripper.
2.  **Grasp Liquid Bottle:** The robot grasps a white liquid bottle with a red cap from the cabinet using its gripper.
3.  **Place Liquid Bottle:** The robot places the liquid bottle onto the lab counter.
4.  **Open Drawer 1:** The robot opens the first drawer using its gripper.
5.  **Grasp Plastic Pipette:** The robot grasps a plastic pipette from a plastic bag inside the open drawer using its gripper.
6.  **Close Drawer 1:** The robot closes the first drawer.
7.  **Open Drawer 2:** The robot opens the second drawer using its gripper.
8.  **Grasp Two Plastic Cups:** The robot grasps two plastic cups from the second drawer using its gripper.
9.  **Close Drawer 2:** The robot closes the second drawer.
10. **Move Items to Scaling Station:** The robot moves the liquid bottle, pipette, and two plastic cups to the scaling station.
11. **Place All Items on Metal Tray:** The robot places all gathered items (bottle, pipette, cups) onto a metal tray at the scaling station.
12. **Tare Scale (Initial):** The robot presses the "TARE" button on the scale to zero it, if not already at zero.
13. **Grasp Plastic Cup 1:** The robot grasps one of the plastic cups (Cup 1) using its gripper.
14. **Place Plastic Cup 1 on Scale:** The robot places Plastic Cup 1 onto the scale.
15. **Tare Scale (Cup Weight):** Once the scale reading is stable, the robot presses the "TARE" button again to zero the scale, effectively negating the weight of the cup.
16. **Unscrew Red Cap:** The robot unscrews the red cap from the liquid bottle using its gripper.
17. **Grasp Plastic Pipette:** The robot grasps the plastic pipette.
18. **Squeeze Pipette Bulb:** The robot squeezes the bulb of the plastic pipette.
19. **Insert Pipette into Liquid Bottle:** The robot dips the tip of the pipette into the liquid inside the bottle.
20. **Draw Liquid:** The robot gently releases the pipette bulb to draw liquid into the pipette.
21. **Move Pipette over Cup 1:** The robot moves the pipette over Plastic Cup 1, which is on the scale.
22. **Dispense Liquid Drop by Drop:** The robot carefully dispenses the liquid from the pipette into Cup 1, observing the scale reading increase using its vision sensor.
23. **Check Weight:** The robot continuously checks if the scale reading has reached 1.00 gram.
    *   **If not 1.00g:** Continue dispensing liquid drop by drop (loop back to step 22).
    *   **If 1.00g is reached:** Proceed to the next step.
24. **Move Pipette over Plastic Cup 2:** If any liquid remains in the pipette after reaching 1.00g in Cup 1, the robot moves the pipette over Plastic Cup 2 (the unused cup).
25. **Dispense Remaining Liquid:** The robot dispenses any remaining liquid from the pipette into Plastic Cup 2 to avoid re-introducing it to the source bottle.
26. **Place Pipette:** The robot places the plastic pipette back on the metal tray.
27. **Screw Red Cap:** The robot screws the red cap back onto the liquid bottle.
28. **Verify Measurement:** The robot performs a final check using its vision sensor to ensure the scale still displays 1.00g.
